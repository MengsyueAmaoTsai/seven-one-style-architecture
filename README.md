# ðŸ§± 7-1 Style Architecture Showcase

This repo demonstrates how to implement the **7-1 style architecture pattern** in various UI frameworks.

> The 7-1 architecture (7 folders + 1 entry file) is a modular design system organization method originally popularized in SCSS. This repository adapts it to other frameworks for scalable and maintainable styling.

| Framework   | Folder  | Notes                                |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| SCSS / Sass | `/scss` | Classic 7-1 pattern with `main.scss` |
| WPF / XAML  | `/wpf`  | ResourceDictionary modular styling   |

## ðŸ“¦ Goal

To provide clear, framework-specific examples of how to apply:

- Layered styling
- Reusable design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Modular component styles
- Theming and vendor overrides
